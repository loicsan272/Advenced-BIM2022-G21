00:00:30.062 --> 00:00:34.448
Old tool takes this ratio,
merged it with the volume

7280ef57-26cf-4c84-a4c7-cf11a7d7d299/2708-1
00:00:34.448 --> 00:00:39.578
information on the IFC model
that calculates the densities of

7280ef57-26cf-4c84-a4c7-cf11a7d7d299/2708-2
00:00:39.578 --> 00:00:44.956
the elements and their weights.
Now we will explain how the code

7280ef57-26cf-4c84-a4c7-cf11a7d7d299/2708-3
00:00:44.956 --> 00:00:45.452
works.

7280ef57-26cf-4c84-a4c7-cf11a7d7d299/2777-0
00:00:46.402 --> 00:00:51.070
I am late and I explained the
code so our tools take the

7280ef57-26cf-4c84-a4c7-cf11a7d7d299/2777-1
00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:56.229
information of the steel ratio
on the concrete density in a in

7280ef57-26cf-4c84-a4c7-cf11a7d7d299/2777-2
00:00:56.229 --> 00:01:01.225
an Excel file and then it use
the volume of the element that

7280ef57-26cf-4c84-a4c7-cf11a7d7d299/2777-3
00:01:01.225 --> 00:01:06.384
we find in the IFC file in order
to get all the values that it

7280ef57-26cf-4c84-a4c7-cf11a7d7d299/2777-4
00:01:06.384 --> 00:01:11.707
need we need and and then it put
everything in an Excel file for

7280ef57-26cf-4c84-a4c7-cf11a7d7d299/2777-5
00:01:11.707 --> 00:01:14.982
the output using an product data
frame.

7280ef57-26cf-4c84-a4c7-cf11a7d7d299/2789-0
00:01:15.772 --> 00:01:21.102
And so nakaa will talk about the
BPMN.

7280ef57-26cf-4c84-a4c7-cf11a7d7d299/2797-0
00:01:23.792 --> 00:01:26.882
Hi I am nakaa I would present.

7280ef57-26cf-4c84-a4c7-cf11a7d7d299/2816-0
00:01:27.022 --> 00:01:32.784
And and a process map of our
tool and in the upper part

7280ef57-26cf-4c84-a4c7-cf11a7d7d299/2816-1
00:01:32.784 --> 00:01:38.442
reference information we use the
geographic geometric.

7280ef57-26cf-4c84-a4c7-cf11a7d7d299/2867-0
00:01:38.522 --> 00:01:44.773
Yeah, properties and in the
pillow part here where the

7280ef57-26cf-4c84-a4c7-cf11a7d7d299/2867-1
00:01:44.773 --> 00:01:51.591
exchange information exchange
and we use this as a input 3D

7280ef57-26cf-4c84-a4c7-cf11a7d7d299/2867-2
00:01:51.591 --> 00:01:57.955
model design input and the
document document output and

7280ef57-26cf-4c84-a4c7-cf11a7d7d299/2867-3
00:01:57.955 --> 00:02:04.432
design model output in the
middle here the how our tool.

7280ef57-26cf-4c84-a4c7-cf11a7d7d299/2887-0
00:02:04.572 --> 00:02:09.529
And develop from the initial
design model to the developed

7280ef57-26cf-4c84-a4c7-cf11a7d7d299/2887-1
00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:13.562
design model and the develop
code to calculate.

7280ef57-26cf-4c84-a4c7-cf11a7d7d299/2894-0
00:02:13.742 --> 00:02:16.792
And and and volume.

7280ef57-26cf-4c84-a4c7-cf11a7d7d299/2896-0
00:02:18.792 --> 00:02:19.172
